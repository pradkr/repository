      <h2>Superman</h2>
      <p>
        Superman is often depicted with a mix of idealism, restraint, fairness,
        and compassion. The Birthright limited series attributes Superman's
        compassion for living things to his ability to see their "auras". He
        also struggles with the differences between what is right and what is
        practical.

      <h2>Batman</h2>
      <p>
        Batman's primary character traits can be summarized as "wealth; physical
        prowess; deductive abilities and obsession". The details and tone of
        Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative
        teams.

      <h2>Spiderman</h2>
      <p>
        Spider-Man is capable of tossing about automobiles as if they weighed no
        more than a phone book. Incredible ability and speed. The ability to
        cling to nearly any surface, allowing him to literally walk on walls.
        And an eerie form of ESP that alerts him to potential danger.
