      <p>
        A lion was once sleeping in the jungle when a mouse started running up
        and down his body just for fun. This disturbed the lion’s sleep, and he
        woke up quite angry. He was about to eat the mouse when the mouse
        desperately requested the lion to set him free. “I promise you, I will
        be of great help to you someday if you save me.” The lion laughed at the
        mouse’s confidence and let him go.

        Birbal immediately smiled and went up to Akbar. He announced the answer;
        he said there were twenty-one thousand, five hundred and twenty-three
        crows in the city. When asked how he knew the answer, Birbal replied,
        “Ask your men to count the number of crows. If there are more, then the
        relatives of the crows must be visiting them from nearby cities. If
        there are fewer, then the crows from our city must be visiting their
        relatives who live outside the city.” Pleased with the answer, Akbar
        presented Birbal with a ruby and pearl chain.
